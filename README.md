# game

This was my first project as part of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. 
With only two weeks of programming experience, I had five days to create a
game using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

Power Through, a.k.a. Ironhack: The Game is a falling objects game "loosely"
based on my experiences at Ironhack. 

The goal: utilize as much free coffee, snacks, and electricity as possible to avoid 
blockers, frustration, and infinite loops and become the best web developer ever. 

I plan to improve the responsiveness on all screen sizes and the instructions page.
